# HR-Management-information-system

. this project has no backend so it's fronted only feel free to do everything because i have not set any password there for simplfying testing part. just i showed how everything will look like.

.i used html, css, bootstrap and javascript as technologies

.i minimized only pages you mentioned in the link we've given on Figma account
.even this fronted is not responsive according to the short time we have given, i didn't tried to set every division or everything as it is in order to make it responsive. so if i got a chance to extend time like a day i can do it properly
